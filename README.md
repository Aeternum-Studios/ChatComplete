# Chat Complete
The ultimate chat tab completer

### How does this work?
Chat Complete uses Google search's auto completer to fill in a player's message using the last 3 words. Due to the way the client handles tab completes, it is not currently possible to provide a phrase as an option. Also, due to a 1.13 bug, Chat Complete is only available for 1.12 and below.

### Permissions:
- 'chatcomplete.use'
  - true by default
